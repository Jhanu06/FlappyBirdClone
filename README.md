# Game Project - Flappy Bird Clone

**Build a Flappy Bird Clone With Phaser**  
**Prerequisites**: HTML, JavaScript  
**Versions**: Phaser 3.55.2

This is a Flappy Bird clone created using Phaser 3, a popular HTML5 game development framework. The game includes basic gameplay mechanics such as controlling a bird that must navigate through columns, with the objective of reaching the right edge of the screen.

## Key Features:
- Physics Engine: Arcade physics for gravity, bouncing, and collisions.
- Collision Detection: Checks for collisions between the bird and obstacles (columns).
- User Input: Arrow keys to control the bird's movement and space bar to start the game.
- Responsive Design: The game adjusts to different screen sizes.

## How it Works:
- The game starts when the space bar is pressed.
- The up arrow key controls the birdâ€™s vertical movement.
- The goal is to avoid obstacles (columns) and reach the right edge to win.
- Game-over occurs when the bird hits an obstacle or the ground.
